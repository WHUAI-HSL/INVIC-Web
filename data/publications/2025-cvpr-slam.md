# Visual SLAM in Dynamic Environments

**Authors:** Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Wu

**Venue:** CVPR 2025

**Abstract:**
This paper presents a novel approach to visual SLAM in highly dynamic environments. Our method combines deep learning-based object detection with traditional SLAM techniques to achieve robust localization and mapping in crowded scenes.

## Key Contributions
1. Novel dynamic object detection and filtering mechanism
2. Real-time performance on embedded systems
3. State-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI dataset

## Results
Our approach achieves 95% accuracy on the KITTI benchmark, outperforming previous methods by 12%.
